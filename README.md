This project represents a new process and system that combines hyperspectral imaging with advanced machine-learning techniques for detecting and classifying adulterants in Stevia. It integrates a robust feature extraction and feature selection framework. The system employs multiple classification models, ensuring highly accurate adulteration identification across varying sample compositions.This invention provides a non-destructive, scalable, and highly accurate solution for food quality assurance, surpassing conventional detection methods in precision and applicability.
The invention focuses on detecting adulteration in stevia, a widely used natural sweetener valued for its zero-calorie profile and health benefits derived from the leaves of Stevia Rebaudiana plant, particularly for diabetic and health-conscious populations. Due to its high market demand and cost, stevia is often adulterated with lower-cost substances, which can compromise quality and pose health risks.
The system captures hyperspectral images sized 512×512×204 pixels using an NIR hyperspectral camera with a spectral range of 400 nm–1000 nm. 

Both spatial and spectral features are analyzed:
Feature Extraction: Morphological Operations, 1D Wavelet Transform, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Factor Analysis, and 2D Wavelet Transform.
Feature selection: Chi Square Test, Information Gain, Fisher Score, Relief Algorithm and Feature Selection via Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy (FSMRMR).
Classification: Support Vector Machines, Multinomial Regression, Random Forest.
